# The Python Password System

While messing around with a school project, I decided to make a login system. The difference is that with an admin user, you can delete accounts and change information about them.

# The Downside
You can't register accounts, which is why I'm on here.

If you think you can help, get in touch over GitHub. I would love to find a way for people who aren't on the system to be able to register. Thanks.
